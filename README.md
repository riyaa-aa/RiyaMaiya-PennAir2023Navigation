# Readme File

Answer the following questions after you have completed your coding challenge. Please be truthful in your responses. Remember we are looking for commitment and willingness to learn, not previous knowledge, so don’t get discouraged if you’re having trouble. You have done the hard work already, so be clear, yet brief in your answers.


# Questions



1. **How far did you get with the challenge? How much time did it take?**

Got to and completed task 4, took me about a day in total? Maybe 5-6 hours.

2. **Please provide a brief description of the way that you have organized your code.**
    
    1. Be sure to also include total distance traveled and waypoint order from Task 3.

Sequentially ordered; task 1, 2, 3, then 4. Each task is commented before the code for that task is executed.
Task three outputs: 
    The minimum distance to travel to all 14 waypoints = 13358.79556824653
    The shortest route to take = [0, 13, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 3, 2, 1, 0]


3. **Please provide instructions on how to run your code.**

4. **Is there any other relevant information that would be helpful for us to know?**
